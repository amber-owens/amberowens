Phishing is a cyber-attack that uses disguised emails as a weapon.
Flaming is a hostile conversation between two or more people on the internet.
Spam is referred to unsolicited commercial use (UCE)

The definition of spamming and phishing are more closely related than flaming. Flaming is the only one that involves people having a conversation. Spams are just ads that pop up a lot. Phishers try to steal your information. </p>
